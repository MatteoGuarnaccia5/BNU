# BNU
University work for BNU

Repository to store all work from the exercises over each week. Each individual exercise is a seperate commit and is labled with the week and exercise number. They will be kept as draft pull requests.
Assignments will also have their own PRs, but will be merged into `main` upon completion to make it easier for people viewing the repo
